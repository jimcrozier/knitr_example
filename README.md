# knitr_example

This is a simple example of how to knit together tex, pdf, and code chunks in one Rnw. 

To seed the example pdfs run the gen_example_pdf.R script.

To generate the report compile the Rnw in R (RStudio is encouraged). 

To change the title, edit the source/title.tex file. Feel free to add issues if anything is not working.
